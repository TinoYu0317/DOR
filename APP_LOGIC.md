# App Logic & Current Status

This document explains the current state of the application, distinguishing between what is functional logic and what is currently cosmetic/placeholder.

## 1. The Home Page (`/app`)

- **Authentication (✅ Real)**: The app correctly identifies you via Supabase Auth.
- **Center Area (✅ Clean)**: The main center area is now focused on the input. It no longer lists sessions (moved to sidebar).
- **Sidebar History (✅ Real)**: The list of sessions in the sidebar is now fetching **real data** from the `sessions` table in Supabase, sorted by creation time.

## 2. Input Bar & Processing Logic

This is where the biggest distinction lies. **The "Brain" is currently a placeholder.**

- **Model Switcher (❌ Fake)**: 
  - You can select "Gemini 2.0" or "ChatGPT" in the UI.
  - This selection is **ignored by the server**. The backend does not know or care which model you picked. No API calls are made to Google or OpenAI.

- **Submitting Input & Node Generation (⚠️ Functional but Dummy)**:
  - When you type text and hit Enter:
    1. The text is sent to the server.
    2. A new Session is created in the database.
    3. The Title is generated from the first 6 words of your input.
    4. **Nodes are NOT generated by AI.**
    5. Instead, the code explicitly creates exactly **3 Nodes** named "Node 1", "Node 2", and "Node 3".
    6. It fills these nodes by simply slicing your text into chunks.

## 3. The Session View (`/session/[id]`)

- **Redirect (✅ Real)**: You are correctly redirected to the new session page.
- **Bubble Map (✅ Real Rendering, Fake Data)**: It helps visualize the nodes, but since the nodes are the dummy ones created above, the map always looks roughly the same (3 nodes).

## Summary Table

| Feature | Status | Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | ✅ Real | Uses Supabase Auth. |
| **Input Bar** | ✅ Real | Captures text and submits to server. |
| **Model Switcher** | ❌ Fake | Visual only. Backend ignores it. |
| **Node Generation** | ❌ Fake | No AI. Always generates 3 dummy nodes "Node 1-3". |
| **Session Title** | ✅ Real | Generated from input text (first 6 words). |
| **Sidebar List** | ❌ Fake | Hardcoded loop [1, 2, 3]. |
| **Center List** | ✅ Real | Fetches actual sessions from DB. |
